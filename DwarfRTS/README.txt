Very Primitive version of pacman. I tried to make the level and packman look authentic as possible. I had less time to make the enemies work. What I would have done
to get the same movement behavior for both pacman and the enemies is to build a track system. Basically you travel from waypoint to waypoint, each one being placed somewhere you can make a turn.
It would have been fairly easy to make the enemy make a random decision on which next waypoint to travel to.

Right now pacman can move in 8 directions. The enemies only move in 4 directions and try to turn right if they hit a wall, this is somewhat glitchy and they sometimes just turn around.
You can pick up 150 pellets to win the game, and the power pellets simply turn pacman green, letting you know that you have about 10 seconds to kill any ghosts in your way. Enemy ghosts
dont respawn, and when you are killed, the level starts over.

Yes you can teleport if you use the left or right tunnels.
