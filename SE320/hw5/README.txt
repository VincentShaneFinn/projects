There are an incredible amount of tests you would have to write if you opted for stronger criteria. 
You could do adding one item, another test for deleting that item, an extra test for adding 1 or 2 items, deleting both of those items, collapsing the controlls at any point.
I have included both my eventflo diagram, and what I thought a reasonable event interaction coverage diagram might look like. The first has just 8 connections while the second has over 20.
In either case, it limits the list to 2 items at max, and realistically you might try even more than that, which would grow exponentially.
