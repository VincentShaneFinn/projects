Red Black Tree implementation testing
achieving 100% statement and branch coverage for the relevant parts of the program. 
You'll also be briefly analyzing the testability of the code and reflecting on its use of Design by Contract.

for 100% statement coverage write a few tests for each method in class

To measure the code coverage of your test suite from the command line, run

./gradlew test jacocoTestReport

	
IsEmpty
	Tree is actually empty
	Tree is not empty
	
Put and Get
	Put Null Key
	Put Null Value
	Get Null
	Get on Empty Tree
	Put and get 1 Item
	Put and get several Items
	Put duplicate key
	Put 0 key
	Put Negative key
	Put Positive Integer.Max key
	Put Negative Integer.Max key
	
	I did pretty well on code coverage here my first run, only forgot to test if the key is null
	
	Maybe Put keys in different orders
	Maybe Try to Put a ton of pairs in the tree
 
Contains
	Contains Value
	Doesn't Contain Value
	Contains Null
 
Delete, Min, Max, and with key
	Delete Min
	Delete Max
	Delete Key
	Delete Null Keys
	Delete From Empty Tree, Min and Max
	
	I cannot figure out how to build a tree that has a the root's children be left black and right red, I assume it is impossible
	other than that my initial tests reach code coverage asside from this case in each method.
 
Minimum
	Min of Empty Tree
	Min of Single Value Tree
	Min of Multiple Value Tree
	Min of Tree with Int Min and Max
	
Maximum
	Max of Empty Tree
	Max of Single Value Tree
	Max of Multiple Value Tree
	Max of Tree with Int Min and Max
	
Floor
	Floor of Empty Tree
	Floor with Null key
	Floor of Single Value Tree
	Floor of Multiple Value Tree
	There is No Item Less than given value
	Floor of Max and Min
	Floor of Zero
	Floor of Negative
	
Ceiling
	Ceiling of Empty Tree
	Ceiling of Single Value Tree
	Ceiling of Multiple Value Tree
	There is No Item Greater than given value
	Ceiling of Max and Min
	Ceiling of Zero
	Ceiling of Negative
	
Rank
	Rank Value is Null
	Rank Tree is Empty
	Rank Single Value Tree
	Rank Multiple Value Tree
	There are no Items Less than given value
	Rank of Max and Min
	Rank of Zero
	Rank of Negative
Keys
	Keys of empty tree
	Keys of lo is null
	Keys of hi is null
	Keys of single tree
		test with bad Lo and Hi
	Keys of multiple tree
		test with bad Lo and Hi
Size
	Size of empty tree
	Size of lo is null
	Size of hi is null
	Size of single tree
		test with bad Lo and Hi
	Size of multiple tree
		test with bad Lo and Hi
