java -jar target/se_311-lab3.jar
or use java -jar target/se_311-lab3

If you look at how I setup the file system, I start with a root, then add the Documents, Desktop, and Photos directors.
From there I add a number of files and folders to these until the component system is made.

If you run the program it will print the 3 lab requirements, 
	the file path of each file / folders,
	the total number of files (folder or file counts), as well as the total bytes,
	and prints a sorted list of all the files / folders
